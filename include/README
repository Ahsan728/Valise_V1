This directory is intended for project header files.

Here we are using two header files. ADS131M08.h is for ADC and SAMD21turboPWM.h is for generating high frequency clock signal. 

ADS131M08.h Description:
> All 49 register has been defined through address with the ID name from datasheet
> All 49 registers reset value has been defined.
> A class named ADS131M08 has been declared -
        - SPISettings(spiClk, MSBFIRST, SPI_MODE1)
        - Dummy word frame to write ADC during ADC data reads.


SAMD21turboPWM.h Description:
> Generic Clock (GCLK) of SAMD boards with 96MHz register value defined.
> A class named TurboPWM has been declared -
        - Main clock divider: 1 to 255 for both TCC0 and TCC1 (TCC:Timer Counter Control)
        - False for 48MHz clock, true for 96MHz clock
        - Table for looking up and storing values for TCCx
        - Tables for looking up pin mappings etc. for different boards
