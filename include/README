Here we are using two header files. ADS131M08.h is for ADC and SAMD21turboPWM.h is for generating high frequency clock signal. 
##This directory is intended for project header files.

Here we are using two header files. ADS131M08.h is for ADC and SAMD21turboPWM.h is for generating high frequency clock signal. 

ADS131M08.h Description:
All 49 register has been defined through address with the ID name from datasheet
All 49 registers reset value has been defined.
A class named ADS131M08 has been declared -
SPISettings(spiClk, MSBFIRST, SPI_MODE1)
Dummy word frame to write ADC during ADC data reads.


SAMD21turboPWM.h Description:
Generic Clock (GCLK) of SAMD boards with 96MHz register value defined.
A class named TurboPWM has been declared -
Main clock divider: 1 to 255 for both TCC0 and TCC1 (TCC:Timer Counter Control)
False for 48MHz clock, true for 96MHz clock
Table for looking up and storing values for TCCx
Tables for looking up pin mappings etc. for different boards

```src/main.c


int main (void)
{
 ...
}
```

Including a header file produces the same results as copying the header file
into each source file that needs it. Such copying would be time-consuming
and error-prone. With a header file, the related declarations appear
in only one place. If they need to be changed, they can be changed in one
place, and programs that include the header file will automatically use the
new version when next recompiled. The header file eliminates the labor of
finding and changing all the copies as well as the risk that a failure to
find one copy will result in inconsistencies within a program.

In C, the usual convention is to give header files names that end with `.h'.
It is most portable to use only letters, digits, dashes, and underscores in
header file names, and at most one dot.
